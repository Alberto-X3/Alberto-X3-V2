# Bad Words

The file [bad_words.csv](bad_words.csv) contains bad words which
will cause messages to be reported to staff or if the total weight
is too high the message will also be deleted automatically.


## The Weight

The weight will determine whether a message is only reported or deleted.
*The default total weight to delete a message is ``100``.*
